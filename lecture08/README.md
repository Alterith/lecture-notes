# Address translation

The material related to this topic is much more amenable to pictorial
rather than verbal representation. Therefore, I will refer you to a
deck of slides that I was using in the lecture.  These slides have
been prepared by Prof. David Culler of UC Berkeley and are used here
with his kind persmission.

Here are the three sets of slides:
- [first set](Culler_address_translation1.pdf)
- [second set](Culler_address_translation2.pdf)
- [third set](Culler_address_translation3.pdf)
